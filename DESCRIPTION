Package: warfarin_doser
Title: Store INR levels and communicate with the anticoagulation team
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person('Chris', 'Beeley', email = 'chris.beeley@gmail.com', role = c('cre', 'aut'))
Description: This package serves two functions. Firstly it stores the 
  results of INR tests for individuals who take warfarin, and visualises them. 
  Secondly, it automatically sends emails to the team containing name, NHS number 
  and DOB. These can easily be configured per user in the YAML file. THIS 
  APPLICATION PUTS YOUR MEDICAL INFORMATION WHEREVER YOU HOST IT. ONLY DO THIS IF 
  YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISKS. I may in the future add the ability to read the 
  emails that come back with the warfaring dosing, but this will probably only 
  work in Nottingham and will be hard
